# Box Upload - Recursive

This is a Python script that uses os.walk and the [Box SDK for Python][1] to upload files to Box.

First, install the SDK with jwt authentication:

	pip install "boxsdk[jwt]"

Before you can use this script, you'll need to create an app at the [Box Developer][2] website.

Select OAuth 2.0 with JWT and download the JSON file generated by the developer console. Then, authorize the app on your enterprise. The [JWT App Primer for Box][4] has detailed instructions.

Create one or more [App User(s)][3] and grant them access to the folder where you want the script to upload files.

The script also uploads a log file to Box at intervals, so you'll need to create a log folder on Box and grant your App Users access.

The first time you run this script, you will be prompted to create a config.json file if one doesn't already exist.
	
The [Box CLI][5] was very helpful. I used it to generate my App Users.
